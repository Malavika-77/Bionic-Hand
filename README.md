Leading my main project in 2023 during my B.Tech journey, I developed a groundbreaking bionic hand. This innovative prosthetic leverages electromyography (EMG) signals and flex sensors within a data glove to significantly enhance motion recognition accuracy. Employing a cutting-edge Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) Deep Learning approach, this project represents a fusion of technology and compassion, aiming to revolutionize the field of prosthetics. Excited about the potential impact on improving lives through technology.Leading my main project in 2023 during my B.Tech journey, I developed a groundbreaking bionic hand.
